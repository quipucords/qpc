qpc - Inspect and report on product entitlement metadata from various
sources, including networks and systems management solutions.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
\f[V]qpc command subcommand [options]\f[R]
.SS Description
.PP
The Quipucords tool, accessed through the \f[V]qpc\f[R] command, is an
inspection and reporting tool.
It is designed to identify environment data, or \f[I]facts\f[R], such as
the number of physical and virtual systems on a network, their operating
systems, and other configuration data.
In addition, it is designed to identify and report more detailed facts
for some versions of key Red Hat packages and products for the Linux
based IT resources in that network.
The ability to inspect the software and systems that are running on your
network improves your ability to understand and report on your usage.
Ultimately, this inspection and reporting process is part of the larger
system administration task of managing your inventories.
.PP
The Quipucords tool uses two types of configuration to manage the
inspection process.
A \f[I]credential\f[R] contains configuration, such as the username and
password or SSH key of the user that runs the inspection process.
Certain credential types also support the use of an access token as an
alternative authentication method.
A \f[I]source\f[R] defines the entity to be inspected and one or more
credentials to use during the inspection process.
The entity to be inspected can be a host, subnet, network, or systems
management solution such as Openshift, Red Hat Advanced Cluster
Security, Ansible Automation Platform, vCenter Server, or Satellite.
You can save multiple credentials and sources to use with Quipucords in
various combinations as you run inspection processes, or
\f[I]scans\f[R].
When you have completed a scan, you can access the output as a
\f[I]report\f[R] to review the results.
By default, the credentials and sources that are created when using
Quipucords are encrypted in a database.
The values are encrypted with AES-256 encryption.
They are decrypted when the Quipucords server runs a scan by using a
\f[I]vault password\f[R] to access the encrypted values that are stored
in the database.
.PP
The Quipucords tool is an \f[I]agentless\f[R] inspection tool, so there
is no need to install the tool on the sources to be inspected.
.PP
This manual page describes the commands, subcommands, and options for
the \f[V]qpc\f[R] command and includes usage information and example
commands.
.SS Usage

\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]
.PP
To view or save the status information for the server, use the
\f[V]status\f[R] subcommand.
This command returns data about your Quipucords server environment, such
as server build and API versions, environment variable information,
installed prerequisites and versions, and other server metadata that can
help diagnose issues during troubleshooting.
.PP
\f[B]qpc server status [\[en]output-file** \f[BI]path\f[B] **]\f[R]
.PP
\f[V]--output-file=path\f[R]
.PP
Optional.
Sets the path to a file location where the status information is saved.
.SS Credentials
.PP
Use the \f[V]qpc cred\f[R] command to create and manage credentials.
.PP
A credential contains a username-password pair, SSH key, or access token
to authenticate with the remote servers during a scan.
The Quipucords tool uses SSH to connect to servers on the network and
uses credentials to access those servers.
.PP
When a scan runs, it uses a source that contains information such as the
host names, IP addresses, a network, or a systems management solution to
be accessed.
The source also contains references to the credentials that are required
to access those systems.
A single source can contain a reference to multiple credentials as
needed to connect to all systems in that network or systems management
solution.
.PP

.SS Sources
.PP
Use the \f[V]qpc source\f[R] command to create and manage sources.
.PP
A source contains a single entity or a set of multiple entities that are
to be inspected.
A source can be one or more physical machines, virtual machines, or
containers, or it can be a collection of network information, including
IP addresses or host names, or it can be information about a systems
management solution such as Openshift, Red Hat Advanced Cluster
Security, Ansible Automation Platform, vCenter Server, or Satellite.
The source also contains information about the SSH ports and SSH
credentials that are needed to access the systems to be inspected.
The SSH credentials are provided through reference to one or more of the
Quipucords credentials that you configure.
.PP
When you configure a scan, it contains references to one or more
sources, including the credentials that are provided in each source.
Therefore, you can reference sources in different scan configurations
for various purposes, for example, to scan your entire infrastructure or
a specific sector of that infrastructure.
.PP
Creating and Editing Sources
\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]\[ti]
.PP
To create a source, supply the type of source with the \f[V]type\f[R]
option, one or more host names or IP addresses to connect to with the
\f[V]--hosts\f[R] option, and the credentials needed to access those
systems with the \f[V]--cred\f[R] option.
The \f[V]qpc source\f[R] command allows multiple entries for the
\f[V]hosts\f[R] and \f[V]cred\f[R] options.
Therefore, a single source can access a collection of servers and
subnets as needed to create an accurate and complete scan.

option examples.
.PP
\f[V]--cred credential\f[R]
.PP
Contains the name of the credential to use to authenticate to the
systems that are being scanned.
If the individual systems that are being scanned each require different
authentication credentials, you can use more than one credential.
To add multiple credentials to the source, separate each value with a
space, for example:
.PP
\f[V]--cred first_auth second_auth\f[R]
.PP
\f[B]IMPORTANT:\f[R] A credential must exist before you attempt to use
it in a source.
A credential must be of the same type as the source.
.PP
\f[V]--port=port\f[R]
.PP
Optional.
Sets a port to be used for the scan.
This value supports connection and inspection on a non-standard port.
By default, a Network scan uses port 22, vCenter, Ansible, RHACS and
Satellite scans use port 443, and an Openshift scan uses port 6443.
.PP
\f[V]--use-paramiko=(True | False)\f[R]
.PP
Optional.
Changes the Ansible connection method from the default open-ssh to the
python ssh implementation.
.PP

or \f[V]TLSv1_2\f[R].
.PP
\f[V]--disable-ssl=(True | False)\f[R]
.PP
Optional.
Determines whether SSL communication will be disabled for the scan.
.PP
The information in a source might change as the structure of the network
changes.
Use the \f[V]qpc source edit\f[R] command to edit a source to
accommodate those changes.
.PP
Although \f[V]qpc source\f[R] options can accept more than one value,
the \f[V]qpc source edit\f[R] command is not additive.
To edit a source and add a new value for an option, you must enter both
the current and the new values for that option.
Include only the options that you want to change in the
\f[V]qpc source edit\f[R] command.
Options that are not included are not changed.
.PP
\f[B]qpc source edit \[en]name\f[R] \f[I]name\f[R] \f[B][\[en]hosts**

.PP
For example, if a source contains a value of \f[V]server1creds\f[R] for
the \f[V]--cred\f[R] option, and you want to change that source to use
both the \f[V]server1creds\f[R] and \f[V]server2creds\f[R] credentials,
you would edit the source as follows:
.PP

.SS Scans
.PP
Use the \f[V]qpc scan\f[R] command to create, run and manage scans.
.PP
A scan contains a set of one or more sources of any type, plus
additional options that refine how the scan runs, such as the products
to omit from the scan, and the maximum number of parallel system scans.
Because a scan can combine sources of different types, you can include
any combination of Network, OpenShift, Red Hat Advanced Cluster
Security, Ansible Automation Platform, Satellite, and vCenter Server
sources in a single scan.
When you configure a scan to include multiple sources of different
types, for example a Network source and a Satellite source, the same
part of your infrastructure might be scanned more than once.
The results for this type of scan could show duplicate information in
the reported results.
However, you have the option to view the unprocessed detailed report
that would show these duplicate results for each source type, or a
processed deployments report with deduplicated and merged results.
.PP
The creation of a scan groups sources, the credentials contained within
those sources, and the other options so that the act of running the scan
is repeatable.
When you run the scan, each instance is saved as a scan job.

The information in a scan might change as the structure of the network
changes.
Use the \f[V]qpc scan edit\f[R] command to edit an existing scan to
accommodate those changes.
.PP
Although \f[V]qpc scan\f[R] options can accept more than one value, the

For example, if a scan contains a value of \f[V]network1source\f[R] for
the \f[V]--sources\f[R] option, and you want to change that scan to use
both the \f[V]network1source\f[R] and \f[V]satellite1source\f[R]

.SS Security Considerations
.PP
The authentication data in the credentials and the network-specific and
system-specific data in sources are stored in an AES-256 encrypted value
within a database.
A vault password is used to encrpyt and decrypt values.
The vault password and decrypted values are in the system memory, and
could theoretically be written to disk if memory swapping is enabled.
