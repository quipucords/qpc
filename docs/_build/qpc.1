.TH "qpc" "1" "December 16, 2024" "" "qpc"
.SH NAME
.sp
qpc \- Inspect and report on product entitlement metadata from various sources, including networks and systems management solutions.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBqpc command subcommand [options]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The Quipucords tool, accessed through the \fBqpc\fP command, is an inspection and reporting tool. It is designed to identify environment data, or \fIfacts\fP, such as the number of physical and virtual systems on a network, their operating systems, and other configuration data. In addition, it is designed to identify and report more detailed facts for some versions of key Red Hat packages and products for the Linux based IT resources in that network. The ability to inspect the software and systems that are running on your network improves your ability to understand and report on your usage. Ultimately, this inspection and reporting process is part of the larger system administration task of managing your inventories.
.sp
The Quipucords tool uses two types of configuration to manage the inspection process. A \fIcredential\fP contains configuration, such as the username and password or SSH key of the user that runs the inspection process. Certain credential types also support the use of an access token as an alternative authentication method. A \fIsource\fP defines the entity to be inspected and one or more credentials to use during the inspection process. The entity to be inspected can be a host, subnet, network, or systems management solution such as Openshift, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security, Ansible Automation Platform, vCenter Server, or Satellite. You can save multiple credentials and sources to use with Quipucords in various combinations as you run inspection processes, or \fIscans\fP\&. When you have completed a scan, you can access the output as a \fIreport\fP to review the results.
By default, the credentials and sources that are created when using Quipucords are encrypted in a database. The values are encrypted with AES\-256 encryption. They are decrypted when the Quipucords server runs a scan by using a \fIvault password\fP to access the encrypted values that are stored in the database.
.sp
The Quipucords tool is an \fIagentless\fP inspection tool, so there is no need to install the tool on the sources to be inspected.
.sp
This manual page describes the commands, subcommands, and options for the \fBqpc\fP command and includes usage information and example commands.

Optional. Sets the path to a file location where the status information is saved.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH CREDENTIALS
.sp
Use the \fBqpc cred\fP command to create and manage credentials.
.sp
A credential contains a username\-password pair, SSH key, or access token to authenticate with the remote servers during a scan. The Quipucords tool uses SSH to connect to servers on the network and uses credentials to access those servers.
.sp
When a scan runs, it uses a source that contains information such as the host names, IP addresses, a network, or a systems management solution to be accessed. The source also contains references to the credentials that are required to access those systems. A single source can contain a reference to multiple credentials as needed to connect to all systems in that network or systems management solution.
.SS Creating and Editing Credentials
.sp
To create a credential, supply the type of credential and supply SSH credentials as either a username\-password pair, a username\-key pair, or an access token. The Quipucords tool stores each set of credentials in a separate credential entry.
.sp
\fBqpc cred add \-\-name=\fP \fIname\fP \fB\-\-type=\fP \fI(network | vcenter | satellite | openshift | rhacs | ansible)\fP \fB\-\-username=\fP \fIusername\fP \fB(\-\-password | \-\-sshkey\fP)** \fB[\-\-sshpassphrase]\fP \fB\-\-become\-method=\fP \fI(sudo | su | pbrun | pfexec | doas | dzdo | ksu | runas )\fP \fB\-\-become\-user=\fP \fIuser\fP \fB[\-\-become\-password]\fP \fB[\-\-token]\fP
.sp
\fB\-\-name=name\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Required. Sets the name of the new credential. For the value, use a descriptive name that is meaningful to your organization. For example, you could identify the user or server that the credential relates to, such as \fBadmin12\fP or \fBserver1_jdoe\fP\&. Do not include the password as part of this value, because the value for the \fB\-\-name\fP option might be logged or printed during \fBqpc\fP execution.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-type=type\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Required. Sets the type of credential. The value must be \fBnetwork\fP, \fBvcenter\fP, \fBsatellite\fP, \fBopenshift\fP, \fBrhacs\fP or \fBansible\fP\&. You cannot edit a credential\(aqs type after creating it.

.SS Clearing Credentials
.sp
As the network infrastructure changes, it might be necessary to delete some credentials. Use the \fBclear\fP subcommand to delete credentials.
.sp
\fBIMPORTANT:\fP Remove or change the credential from any source that uses it \fIbefore\fP clearing a credential. Otherwise, any attempt to use the source to run a scan runs the command with a nonexistent credential, an action that causes the \fBqpc\fP command to fail.
.sp
\fBqpc cred clear (\-\-name\fP \fIname\fP \fB| \-\-all)\fP
.sp
\fB\-\-name=name\fP
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH SOURCES
.sp
Use the \fBqpc source\fP command to create and manage sources.
.sp
A source contains a single entity or a set of multiple entities that are to be inspected. A source can be one or more physical machines, virtual machines, or containers, or it can be a collection of network information, including IP addresses or host names, or it can be information about a systems management solution such as Openshift, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security, Ansible Automation Platform, vCenter Server, or Satellite. The source also contains information about the SSH ports and SSH credentials that are needed to access the systems to be inspected. The SSH credentials are provided through reference to one or more of the Quipucords credentials that you configure.
.sp
When you configure a scan, it contains references to one or more sources, including the credentials that are provided in each source. Therefore, you can reference sources in different scan configurations for various purposes, for example, to scan your entire infrastructure or a specific sector of that infrastructure.
.SS Creating and Editing Sources
.sp
To create a source, supply the type of source with the \fBtype\fP option, one or more host names or IP addresses to connect to with the \fB\-\-hosts\fP option, and the credentials needed to access those systems with the \fB\-\-cred\fP option. The \fBqpc source\fP command allows multiple entries for the \fBhosts\fP and \fBcred\fP options. Therefore, a single source can access a collection of servers and subnets as needed to create an accurate and complete scan.
.sp
\fBqpc source add \-\-name=\fP \fIname\fP  \fB\-\-type=\fP \fI(network | vcenter | satellite | openshift | rhacs | ansible)\fP \fB\-\-hosts\fP \fIip_address\fP \fB\-\-cred\fP \fIcredential\fP \fB[\-\-exclude\-hosts\fP \fIip_address\fP \fB]\fP \fB[\-\-port=\fP \fIport\fP \fB]\fP \fB[\-\-use\-paramiko=\fP \fI(True | False)\fP \fB]\fP \fB[\-\-ssl\-cert\-verify=\fP \fI(True | False)\fP \fB]\fP \fB[\-\-ssl\-protocol=\fP \fIprotocol\fP \fB]\fP \fB[\-\-disable\-ssl=\fP \fI(True | False)\fP \fB]\fP

.INDENT 3.5
Required. Sets the type of source.  The value must be \fBnetwork\fP, \fBvcenter\fP, \fBsatellite\fP, \fBopenshift\fP, \fBrhacs\fP, or \fBansible\fP\&. The type cannot be edited after a source is created.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-hosts ip_address\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Sets the host name, IP address, or IP address range to use when running a scan. You can also provide a path for a file that contains a list of host names or IP addresses or ranges, where each item is on a separate line. The following examples show several different formats that are allowed as values for the \fB\-\-hosts\fP option:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A specific host name:
.sp
\fB\-\-hosts server.example.com\fP
.IP \(bu 2
A specific IP address:
.sp
\fB\-\-hosts 192.0.2.19\fP
.IP \(bu 2
An IP address range, provided in CIDR or Ansible notation. This value is only valid for the \fBnetwork\fP type:
.sp

.INDENT 3.5
Optional. Sets the host name, IP address, or IP address range to exclude when running a scan. Values for this option use the same formatting as the \fB\-\-hosts\fP option examples.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-cred credential\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Contains the name of the credential to use to authenticate to the systems that are being scanned. If the individual systems that are being scanned each require different authentication credentials, you can use more than one credential. To add multiple credentials to the source, separate each value with a space, for example:
.sp
\fB\-\-cred first_auth second_auth\fP
.sp
\fBIMPORTANT:\fP A credential must exist before you attempt to use it in a source. A credential must be of the same type as the source.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-port=port\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Optional. Sets a port to be used for the scan. This value supports connection and inspection on a non\-standard port. By default, a Network scan uses port 22, vCenter, Ansible, RHACS and Satellite scans use port 443, and an Openshift scan uses port 6443.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-use\-paramiko=(True | False)\fP

Optional. Determines the SSL protocol to be used for a secure connection during the scan. The value must be \fBSSLv23\fP, \fBTLSv1\fP, \fBLSv1_1\fP, or \fBTLSv1_2\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-disable\-ssl=(True | False)\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Optional. Determines whether SSL communication will be disabled for the scan.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The information in a source might change as the structure of the network changes. Use the \fBqpc source edit\fP command to edit a source to accommodate those changes.
.sp
Although \fBqpc source\fP options can accept more than one value, the \fBqpc source edit\fP command is not additive. To edit a source and add a new value for an option, you must enter both the current and the new values for that option. Include only the options that you want to change in the \fBqpc source edit\fP command. Options that are not included are not changed.
.sp
\fBqpc source edit \-\-name\fP \fIname\fP \fB[\-\-hosts\fP \fIip_address\fP \fB] [\-\-cred\fP \fIcredential\fP \fB] **[\-\-exclude\-hosts\fP \fIip_address\fP \fB] [\-\-port=\fP \fIport\fP \fB]\fP \fB[\-\-use\-paramiko=\fP \fI(True | False)\fP \fB]\fP \fB[\-\-ssl\-cert\-verify=\fP \fI(True | False)\fP \fB]\fP \fB[\-\-ssl\-protocol=\fP \fIprotocol\fP \fB]\fP \fB[\-\-disable\-ssl=\fP \fI(True | False)\fP \fB]\fP
.sp
For example, if a source contains a value of \fBserver1creds\fP for the \fB\-\-cred\fP option, and you want to change that source to use both the \fBserver1creds\fP and \fBserver2creds\fP credentials, you would edit the source as follows:
.sp
\fBqpc source edit \-\-name=mysource \-\-cred server1creds server2creds\fP
.sp
\fBTIP:\fP After editing a source, use the \fBqpc source show\fP command to review those edits.
.SS Listing and Showing Sources
.sp
The \fBqpc source list\fP command returns the details for all configured sources. The output of this command includes the host names, IP addresses, or IP ranges, the credentials, and the ports that are configured for each source.
.sp

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH SCANS
.sp
Use the \fBqpc scan\fP command to create, run and manage scans.
.sp
A scan contains a set of one or more sources of any type, plus additional options that refine how the scan runs, such as the products to omit from the scan, and the maximum number of parallel system scans. Because a scan can combine sources of different types, you can include any combination of Network, OpenShift, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security, Ansible Automation Platform, Satellite, and vCenter Server sources in a single scan. When you configure a scan to include multiple sources of different types, for example a Network source and a Satellite source, the same part of your infrastructure might be scanned more than once. The results for this type of scan could show duplicate information in the reported results. However, you have the option to view the unprocessed detailed report that would show these duplicate results for each source type, or a processed deployments report with deduplicated and merged results.
.sp
The creation of a scan groups sources, the credentials contained within those sources, and the other options so that the act of running the scan is repeatable. When you run the scan, each instance is saved as a scan job.
.SS Creating and Editing Scans
.sp
Use the \fBqpc scan add\fP command to create scan objects with one or more sources. This command creates a scan object that references the supplied sources and contains any options supplied by the user.

Although \fBqpc scan\fP options can accept more than one value, the \fBqpc scan edit\fP command is not additive. To edit a scan and add a new value for an option, you must enter both the current and the new values for that option. Include only the options that you want to change in the \fBqpc scan edit\fP command. Options that are not included are not changed.
.sp
\fBqpc scan edit \-\-name\fP \fIname\fP \fB[\-\-sources=\fP \fIsource_list\fP \fB]\fP \fB[\-\-max\-concurrency=\fP \fIconcurrency\fP \fB]\fP \fB[\-\-disabled\-optional\-products=\fP \fIproducts_list\fP \fB]\fP \fB[\-\-enabled\-ext\-product\-search=\fP \fIproducts_list\fP \fB]\fP \fB[\-\-ext\-product\-search\-dirs=\fP \fIsearch_dirs_list\fP \fB]\fP
.sp
For example, if a scan contains a value of \fBnetwork1source\fP for the \fB\-\-sources\fP option, and you want to change that scan to use both the \fBnetwork1source\fP and \fBsatellite1source\fP sources, you would edit the scan as follows:
.sp
\fBqpc scan edit \-\-name=myscan \-\-sources network1source satellite1source\fP
.sp
If you want to reset the \fB\-\-disabled\-optional\-products\fP, \fB\-\-enabled\-ext\-product\-search\fP, or \fB\-\-ext\-product\-search\-dirs\fP back to their default values, you must provide the flag without any product values.
.sp
For example, if you want to reset the \fB\-\-disabled\-optional\-products\fP option back to the default values, you would edit the scan as follows:
.sp
\fBqpc scan edit \-\-name=myscan \-\-disabled\-optional\-products\fP
.sp
\fBTIP:\fP After editing a scan, use the \fBqpc scan show\fP command to review those edits.
.SS Listing and Showing Scans

Each instance of a scan job is assigned a unique numeric \fIscan job identifier\fP to identify the scan results, so that the results data can be viewed later. Each instance of a scan job is also assigned a numeric \fIreport identifier\fP for the generated report data. Because some scan jobs do not result in report generation, scan job identifiers and report identifiers might not match.

The \fBqpc report deployments\fP command retrieves a report that contains the processed fingerprints from a scan. A \fIfingerprint\fP is the set of system, product, and entitlement facts for a particular physical or virtual machine. A processed fingerprint results from a procedure that merges facts from various sources, and, when possible, deduplicates redundant systems.
.sp
For example, the raw facts of a scan that includes both Network and vCenter sources could show two instances of a machine, indicated by an identical MAC address. The deployments report results in a deduplicated and merged fingerprint that shows both the Network and vCenter facts for that machine as a single set.

.SH SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
.sp
The authentication data in the credentials and the network\-specific and system\-specific data in sources are stored in an AES\-256 encrypted value within a database. A vault password is used to encrpyt and decrypt values. The vault password and decrypted values are in the system memory, and could theoretically be written to disk if memory swapping is enabled.
