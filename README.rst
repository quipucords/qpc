Requirements and Assumptions
----------------------------
Before installing qpc on a system, review the following guidelines about installing and running qpc:

 * qpc is written to run on RHEL or Fedora servers.
 * The system that qpc is installed on must have access to the systems to be discovered and inspected.
 * The target systems must be running SSH.
 * The user account that qpc uses for the SSH connection into the target systems must have adequate permissions to run commands and read certain files, such as privilege escalation required for the ``systemctl`` command.
 * The user account that qpc uses for a machine requires an sh shell or a similar shell. For example, the shell *cannot* be a /sbin/nologin or /bin/false shell.

The Python packages that are required for running qpc on a system can be found in the ``dev-requirements.txt`` file. The Python packages that are required to build and test qpc from source can be found in the ``requirements.txt`` and ``dev-requirements.txt`` files.

Installation
------------
The following information contains instructions for installing qpc.

Command Line
^^^^^^^^^^^^
qpc is available for `download <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/quipucords/qpc/>`_ from the Fedora COPR.

1. Enable the EPEL repo for the server. You can find the appropriate architecture and version on the `EPEL wiki <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`_::

    rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

2. Add the COPR repo to your server. You can find the appropriate architecture and version on the `COPR qpc page <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/quipucords/qpc/>`_::

    wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/group_quipucords-qpc-epel-7.repo \
    https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/quipucords/qpc/repo/epel-7/group_quipucords-qpc-epel-7.repo

3. Install the qpc package::

    yum -y install qpc

Command Syntax and Usage

On Mac run the following command to set up a virtual environment::

    brew install pipenv
    pipenv shell
    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

On Linux run the following command to set up a virtual environment::

    sudo yum install python-tools (or dnf for Fedora)
    pip3 install pipenv
    pipenv shell
    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt


Developing with Insights Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Information on installing and developing with the insights client can be found in `Insights Configuration <insights_configuration.rst>`_.
